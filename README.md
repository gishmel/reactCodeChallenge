# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

REACT Question
The Challenge
Let's write a little component in React, OrderedList, which implements an alphabetically sorted list. The component will include a button to enable the user to sort either in ascending or descending order and a second button to permit the list to be cleared.
Your component should render specific elements according to the following specifications:
An <input /> element which the user can use to add items to the list. This input field should listen for Enter keydown events (the test suite triggers the onKeyDown event handler specifically) to add the current contents (if nonempty) to the list. After adding an item, the input box should be cleared.
A <button> element which the user can click to change the direction of the sort. Initially, the button should display text such as the ⬇️ emoji or the text down. When changed to a descending sort, the button should change to a ⬆️ emoji (or text such as up). 
A <button> element which the user can click to clear the list as well as any contents in the input box (essentially reverting to the component's default state). Use any text you'd like for this button.
A <ul> element, which should contain a series of <li> elements that represent the sorted list contents.
There is no predetermined correct answer for style and CSS. Your solution need not look like the demo below but it should demonstrate understanding of basic CSS and user experience principles.
